Description: WPA Supplicant is a Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) client and IEEE 802.1X supplicant. It implements WPA key negotiation with a WPA Authenticator and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication with an Authentication Server. In addition, it controls the roaming and IEEE 802.11 authentication/association of the wireless LAN driver. This is useful for connecting to a password protected wireless access point.
